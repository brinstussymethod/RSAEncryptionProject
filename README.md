# RSAEncryptionProject
In this project, we are going to implement the well-known RSA algorithm for public-key cryptography, and use the algorithm to encrypt and decrypt a file. 

Required Files:
1. RSAGenKey.java : Generates a private key
2. RSAEncrypt.java : Encrypts a file
3. RSADecrypt.java : Decrypts a file
4. Project 2.doc:  project document
