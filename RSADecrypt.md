###RSADecrypt – Usage Guide
##Overview
RSADecrypt.java is the program that decrypts files encrypted with RSAEncrypt.java using the private key generated by RSAGenKey.java. It reads the encrypted file (.enc), applies RSA decryption with the private key (d, n), and reconstructs the original plaintext into a .dec file.
#Input Files
    
    1. Encrypted file (test.enc)

        Produced by RSAEncrypt.java

Contains space‑separated integers, each representing an encrypted block of 3 characters.

    2. Private key file (pri_key.txt)

        Produced by RSAGenKey.java

        Format:

            d = <private exponent>
            n = <modulus>

#Output File
Decrypted file (test.dec)

    Contains the original plaintext message.

    Spaces and letters are restored using the 00–26 encoding scheme:

        00 -> a, 01 -> b, … 25 -> z, 26 -> space.

#Running the Program
Compile first:

    javac RSADecrypt.java

Run with:

    java RSADecrypt test.enc pri_key.txt

test.enc → encrypted input file

pri_key.txt → private key file

The program will generate:

    test.dec

#Example Workflow
1. Generate keys:

    java RSAGenKey 12
        -> produces pub_key.txt and pri_key.txt.

2. Encrypt a file:

    java RSAEncrypt test.txt pub_key.txt
        -> produces test.enc.

3. Decrypt the file:

    java RSADecrypt test.enc pri_key.txt
        -> produces test.dec (should match test.txt).
